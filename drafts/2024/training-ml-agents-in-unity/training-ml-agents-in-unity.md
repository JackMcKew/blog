I find machine's working automatically to complete a task one of the most fascinating things, imagine how good it feels to watch a machine that learns to do the task on it's own! Especially if you're the teacher, in this blog post, we're going to go through:

1. How to set up an environment in Unity
2. How to interface with ML Agents to train an agent to complete a task
3. Watch our trained model complete the task

Before we dive into anything technical, let's see something I prepared earlier!
