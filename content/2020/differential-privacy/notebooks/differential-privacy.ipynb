    "It's quite clear in today's age that the biggest companies in the world, make most of their profits from harvesting and productionalising their user's data. With privacy becoming more and more of a concern in everyday life as we become more connected, it's almost becoming a human right for our privacy to be protected, especially by those who profit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential privacy in particular is a model that aims to protect the data's owners against bad actors reversing the aggregated data to find details of individual users.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example in this post, we will use a dataset that includes each persons name, age, email and annual income. In this example, say we wanted to determine how many people in our dataset make over $50,000 annually. Instead of sharing all of the specific people and their incomes, we would rather share the aggregate data. Someone viewing our results might know that 30% of our set make over that threshold, but not which people.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However**,  let's say someone viewing the results wants to know the specific income of one person. To do this, they've gone and collected the background information on every person except the person of interest to them. If they know which of the 4999 people make over the threshold, they can determine whether the person of question makes over or under the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of attack is known as a differentiated attack, and is very difficult to protect against, and is what differential privacy aims to defend against. The primary method of achieving privacy is by adding random noise to the aggregate data (the private key in a sense of cryptography). In our example from above our results might say 27% - 32% of people make over the threshold rather than the specific number. This still achieves an outcome that people can understand the results, but protects the privacy of the users within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's use the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `mimesis` to generate the user data\n",
    "2. `pandas` to calculate the exact values (statistical analysis)\n",
    "3. `pydp` to calculate the same values but maintaining privacy of the users"
